# Minimum Absolute Difference in an Array

Consider an array of integers, . We define the absolute difference between two elements,  and  (where ), to be the absolute value of .

Given an array of integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. For example, given the array  we can create  pairs of numbers:  and . The absolute differences for these pairs are ,  and . The minimum absolute difference is .
