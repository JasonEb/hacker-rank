This problem seems to be based off bubble sort, in spirit. It gives a narrative to why a queue will swap, and ultimately the only tweak on the idea is counting the number of swaps while accounting for certain rules. 

The naive solution was implemented, but there are test cases that are meant for a more optimal implementation. In that regard it becomes interesting because Bubble Sort is O(n^2), but to optimize it will require accounting for the bubble sort like swaps while not implementing bubble sort.
