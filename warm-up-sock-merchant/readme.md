# Sock Merchant
This challenge was a warm-up, so the solution wasn't too bad to implement. However, the main challenge was setting up Windows on Linux environment alongside Node and Jest. There were several environmental issues that took up time, then there was time taken to examine hacker rank testing and their code submission format. 

Solution is estimated to be an O(n) runtime. It relies on making using a Javascript Object to keep a map of sock id keys, and their corresponding values would be the count total. After the map is compiled, then another iteration was used to examine each count and get the number of pairs.
